SynonymSwing:
SynonymSwing is a Java-based text generator that uses Hash Map to analyze a given text,
Save and generate new paragraphs based on the frequency of word occurrences.
It utilizes Maps, HashMaps, ConcurrentHashMaps, Priority Queue, Stream and Pattern to store unique keywords and their associated following words,
allowing the user to generate random paragraphs with a similar structure to the analyzed text.

Features:
Analyzes input text and stores word occurrences in a "node" structure
Generates new paragraphs based on the analyzed text
Customizable starting word and paragraph length
Uses a Swing-based GUI for user interaction
Outputs generated text to both the GUI and a text file
Project Structure
The project consists of the following classes:

MainHashTable: Contains all the mainTable instances and manages the insertion and generation of text.
MainLink: Represents a unique keyword and its associated BabyLinkedList.
BabyLink: Represents a word that appears after a given keyword.
BabyLinkedList: Contains all the BabyLink instances for a specific keyword.
TextGeneratorFrame: Provides the graphical user interface for the application.
Usage
Compile and run the TextGeneratorFrame class to launch the GUI.
Use the menu bar to choose the text file containing the text to analyze.
Enter a starting word and the desired number of words for the generated paragraph.
Click the "Generate Text" button to create the new paragraph.
The generated text will be displayed in the text area and saved to a file named "output.txt" in the "output" folder.


Example:
Suppose you have a text file named "input.txt" containing the following text:

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown dog jumps over the lazy fox.

Launch the SynonymSwing application and use the menu to choose "input.txt" as the input file.
Enter "The" as the starting word and "20" as the number of words to generate.
Click the "Generate Text" button.
You might get a generated text similar to this:

The quick brown dog jumps over the lazy fox. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

The generated text is saved in the "output" folder as "output.txt".
